# ChatGPT-Training
I am publicly releasing my method for training chatGPT.

This method was used to train LMG or lawyer mode GPT and can be modified to train GPT overnight with a single machine. Couple this script with my digitalarmy.py script found in Misc-Scripts repo and you have a surefire way of programming an advanced language model without a large physical array of engineering machines. Rather a digital army of virtual machines and servers perform the brunt of the work.

please note you will need to populate the legal_cases.csv file with datasets to train GPT on. You could easily ammend the code to use this method to train GPT on any subject or task.
